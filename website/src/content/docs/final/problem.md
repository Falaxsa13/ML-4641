### Problem & Motivation💡

**CVD early detection** often fails with many symptoms going unnoticed, leading to late diagnoses and preventable complications. The lack of accessible and affordable **preventative care** leaves **underserved populations** at higher risk. Current prevention efforts are limited by the time and expertise needed for accurate early detection.

We propose an **ML model** to analyze patient data and predict **CVD risks**, enabling earlier intervention, improving resource efficiency, and empowering individuals to make informed health decisions 🌍✨.
