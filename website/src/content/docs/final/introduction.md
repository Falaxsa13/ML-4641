# ðŸŒŸ Introduction / Background

**Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)** affect the heart and blood vessels, leading to conditions like **heart attacks** and **strokes**. Heart disease is one of the most known and deadly diseases in the world [[1]](references.md). Thatâ€™s why **early detection** is critical, and **machine learning** has shown promise in improving CVD diagnosis [[2]](references.md).

We propose using the publicly available **Cardiovascular Disease dataset**, with:

- **70,000 patient records**
- **11 features**, including **age, cholesterol**, and **blood pressure**

By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to identify patterns to predict **CVD presence** and enhance early detection efforts [[3]](references.md). The dataset is available [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1728072500349576&usg=AOvVaw1Ix_1oqHLBHuKsN8pvNDNU) ðŸ“Š.

**CVD early detection** often fails with many symptoms going unnoticed, leading to late diagnoses and preventable complications. The lack of accessible and affordable preventative care leaves **underserved populations** at higher risk. Current prevention efforts are limited by the time and expertise needed for accurate early detection. We propose an **ML model** to analyze patient data and predict **CVD risks**, enabling earlier intervention, improving resource efficiency, and empowering individuals to make informed health decisions ðŸ’¡.
