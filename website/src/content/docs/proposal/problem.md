### Problem

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, yet early detection often fails. Many symptoms go unnoticed, leading to late diagnoses and preventable complications. The lack of accessible and affordable preventative care leaves many underserved populations at higher risk. We propose a machine learning model that analyzes patient data to predict cardiovascular disease risks.

### Motivation

Current cardiovascular disease prevention efforts are limited by the time and expertise needed for accurate early detection, leaving many patients unaware of their risks until itâ€™s too late. A machine learning-based risk detection tool can enable healthcare systems to intervene earlier, improving resource efficiency and empowering individuals to take control of their health through informed decisions.
