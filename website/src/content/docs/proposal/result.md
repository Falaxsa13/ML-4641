### Quantitative Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive results among all positive results predicted by the model.
- **Recall**: The ability of the model to find all the positive instances.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

### Project Goals
- 🚀 **Demonstrate the applicability of ML methods** to real-world medical data and assess their reliability compared to existing implementations.
- 🔎 **Gain a deeper understanding of cardiovascular disease** (CVD) and identify the most significant factors contributing to CVD risk.

### Expected Results

- ✅ **Accuracy of ≥ 70%**, based on existing literature.
- 🏆 **Identification of highest risk factors** for cardiovascular disease
