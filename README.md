There are 3 main directories in this repo: implementation, website and .github. However, there shouldn't be a focus on .github

- **Implementation**: This folder contains all things related to the implementation of the ML methods and data cleaning
- **Website**: The basis of the website lives here. /src/content/docs shows the information displayed in the website and /src/assets has the images used in the report
